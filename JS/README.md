# JavaScript is ~~*love*~~ 

Welcome to the JavaScript code examples directory! This directory contains a collection of JavaScript code files.

## Prerequisites

Before you run the JavaScript code examples, make sure you have the necessary tools installed on your system:

### **Mac, Windows (Preferred: WSL), Linux:**

1. **Node.js (JavaScript Interpreter):**
   - We recommend using Node Version Manager (NVM) to install and manage Node.js versions.
   - Install NVM by following the instructions on the [NVM GitHub repository](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

2. **Install Node.js with NVM (Recommended):**
   - After installing NVM, open a new terminal window.
   - Install the LTS (Long Term Support) version of Node.js using NVM: 
     - `nvm install --lts`
   - Set the installed version as the default: 
     - `nvm alias default node`
   - Verify Node.js installation: 
     - `node -v`

## Running the Code

To run the JavaScript code examples:

1. **Run JavaScript:**
   - Navigate to the directory containing the code.
   - Run the code using Node.js: `node filename.js`.

## Alternative (if you encounter environment setup issues):

If you face difficulties setting up your environment or prefer a quick way to run the code, you can use your web browser's developer console.

1. **Using Browser Console (Alternative):**
   - Open your web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox).
   - Right-click on the webpage and select "Inspect" or press `F12` to open the developer tools.
   - Go to the "Console" tab.
   - Copy and paste the code from the JavaScript file (`filename.js`) into the console.
   - Press `Enter` to execute the code.

Note: This method is suitable for quick tests and debugging but may have limitations for more complex code.
